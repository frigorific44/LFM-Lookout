# Lookout!

***Lookout!*** is a Discord Bot for the DDO community, allowing players to view current group advertisements and set timed search queries. Anytime a group is found matching a user's query, they will be notified on Discord with the group's information, helping players find the groups they need, and facilitating interconnectedness in the communityâ€”without requiring that you stayed logged in. As it's name implies, *Lookout!* will do that for you.

To use *Lookout!*, feel free to [invite](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=771959114338926633&scope=bot&permissions=0) it to a server of your own, where you can start exploring its functionality with `lo!help`.
